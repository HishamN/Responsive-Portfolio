            <img src="assets/images/hishamnoman.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Hisham">

            <p>My name is Hisham Noman and I go by Sean. I have a degree on business administration from Georgia State University.
                So for the past 14 years I have been an entrepreneur and I was successful on most of the businesses I got
                in to. I was living in Atlanta Georgia for more than 16 years and I just moved to Orlando Florida on 2016
                to continue my journey as an entrepreneur and started a restaurant with my wife. I always loved the web and
                coding, so I started to teach my self and took some courses online and watched many videos to learn HTML
                and CSS but I always believed that I can change my career and become a successful web developer if I find
                the right source such as UCF Coding Boot Camp, I’ve focused my energies on the web, and I am happy that I
                joined UCF Coding Boot Camp it is a wonderful decision.</p>

            <p>Since I started the Coding Boot camp I now spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useful information. I’m curious, and I enjoy
                work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.</p>
